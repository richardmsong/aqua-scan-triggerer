# Test deployment to verify the webhook is working
# This deployment should trigger the mutating webhook which will inject
# the scheduling gate 'scans.aquasec.community/aqua-scan'
#
# Usage:
#   kubectl apply -f config/samples/test_deployment.yaml
#   kubectl get pods -n default -o yaml | grep schedulingGates
#   kubectl get imagescans -n default
#
# Expected behavior:
#   1. Webhook intercepts pod creation
#   2. Scheduling gate is injected
#   3. Pod stays in SchedulingGated state
#   4. ImageScan CR is created for nginx image
#   5. Once scan passes, gate is removed and pod runs
#
# Cleanup:
#   kubectl delete -f config/samples/test_deployment.yaml
#   kubectl delete imagescans -n default --all
